Verison 1.1.2
==================
- Fixed : regression bug in some polymorphic cases.

Verison 1.1.1
==================
- Added: source Nullable<T> is now mapped to target T. NULL values of Nullable<T> will return default T in this case.
- Added: it is now possible to override default mapping of simple types with initializer.ManualMap().

Verison 1.1.0
==================
- Added: Support of .Net CORE

Version 1.0.10
==================
- Fixed: regression with fill method that could not match when target T type is mapped, but a derived type T' is given.
- Added: inialializer.EnableItemsCacheByDefault(). This option sets the items cache to enables by default for all mappings. Individual mappings can override with DisableItemsCache(). 

Version 1.0.9
==================
- Bug fix: Fixed error that occured for the Fill() method when specified target type is polymorphic.
- Bug fix: Fixed issue with collections containing circular references
- Bug fix: Fixed error when collections contain null values
- Feature change: it is now not necessary to specify "object" as source type when the real type is unknown. We can now use the base class or any sub type.
- Feature change: cache for generated items is now disabled by default since circular references cases are rare. Specify "EnableItemsCache()" to enable it.
- Performance improvement for dictionary and polymorphic cases.

Version 1.0.8
==================
- Bug fix: func mapping didn't apply in some polymorphic cases.
- Bug fix: error that occurs when the same target class (or its subclasses) is mapped to different source classes.
- Bug fix: error that occurs when an interface is used as a property type. The proper concrete class must be used if it exists. 
- Added : Possibility to specify the RetrievalMode (Default, RetrievedWhenSpecified, AlwaysRetrieved) at initialization.

Version 1.0.7
==================
- Bug fix: handled null references for method calls in function mappings.
- Bug fix: AfterMap() and BeforeMap() from base class now called in sub classes
- Bug fix: Overriden function mapping in sub classes did not take precedence over the base class.

Version 1.0.6
==================
- Added MapExclude() feature
- Bug fix: custom function mapping now apply on sub classes.

Version 1.0.5
==================
- Added AfterMap() and BeforeMap() features

Version 1.0.4
==================
- Fixed exception when passing static members in delegates
- Throw proper exception when the specified type is not mapped

Version 1.0.3
==================
- Fixed null exceptions when using inclusions in some cases.
- Fixed null exceptions when there is a null item in collections

Version 1.0.2
==================
Added project URL in nuget spec file.

Version 1.0.1
==================
Fixed some bug that occured when collections contained unmapped objects.

Version 1.0.0

==================
First release
